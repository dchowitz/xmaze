# MAZE DEMOS

Some implementations of maze algorithms.

Heavily inspired by the book [Mazes for
Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers) and Mike
Bostock's [maze generation
visualizations](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/#maze-generation).

The demos are life [here](https://mazedemos.dchowitz.com).
